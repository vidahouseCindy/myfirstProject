# myfirstProject
本次第一次上传项目，总结下上传步骤：
上传中出现的问题以及解决方案：
操作把本地仓库代码上传到githubgit时： push -u origin master
 出现以下语句：
failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:vidahouseCindy/myfirstRepository.git'
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:vidahouseCindy/myfirstRepository.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
